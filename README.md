I'm a data scientist with a background in linguistics, which gives me a unique edge in my work. I love diving into computational linguistics and data analysis - it's where my passion for language meets my skills in tech. After completing Northwestern's Data Science Boot Camp, I've honed my skills in Python, SQL, and NLP.

Machine learning fascinates me, and I enjoy creating visualizations that make complex data easy to understand. I've found that my knack for data visualization, especially with tools like Tableau, helps teams make better decisions based on solid data. Working with diverse teams, often remotely, has taught me a lot about collaboration and communication in tech. 

PS - my name is Can. It's Turkish, and it's pronounced pretty much like "Jon" in English.
